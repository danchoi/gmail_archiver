# GmailArchiver

This project is not released yet. I'm just using Github as a backup
mechanism at this point while I develop this.

The goal is to let you suck out all your email from Gmail and put it
into PostgreSQL. Because I think PostgreSQL is a great way to archive
tens of thousands of emails and make it possible do more stuff with
them, more easily.

Also, I wanted to build a more powerful version of Vmail that uses a
PostgreSQL datastore. This is essential for message threading and also
for making Vmail operate with the same level of performance as Mutt, but
with even more versatility. GmailArchiver will eventually be merged into
Vmail.

Also I will try to make it possible to substitute other datastore
backends through adapter classes.
