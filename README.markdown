# GmailArchiver

This project is not released yet. I'm just using Github as a backup
mechanism at this point while I develop this.

The goal is to let you suck out all your email from Gmail and put it
into PostgreSQL. Because I think PostgreSQL is a great way to archive
tens of thousands of emails and do stuff with them with tools in any
language. 

Also, I wanted to build a more powerful version of Vmail that uses a
PostgreSQL datastore. This is essential for message threading and also
for making Vmail operate with the same level of performance as Mutt, but
with even more versatility.

Also I will try to make it possible to substitute other datastore
backends through adapter classes.
